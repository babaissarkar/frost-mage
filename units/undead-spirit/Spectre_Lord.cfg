    description= _ "An extremly dangerous spirit that has waited for eons to cross over to the human lands to enact revenge. Often they start as mere Sceptres who have gathered strength and amassed support in the Land of the Dead, waiting for the right moment when a weak-willed necromancer allows them entry in living world. They are never alone, and their army follows in their wake. Their control over undead forces is something a necromancer can only dream of. And it is best not to talk about their fighting prowess... except that the title of Sceptre Lord is well earned."
